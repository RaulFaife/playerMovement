# TerminalPlayerMovement
 I wanted to get more practice with C++ so I made a player controller that works in the terminal, where the number 1 changes with the WASD controls

The above image was when I first started and only had one Axis of movement. From there I had a better sense on how I need to change up my array to make it 2 dimensions. <br>

So I ended up making it a clean two dimensional array as shown above. <br>
